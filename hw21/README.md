he "payments" struct has 8 properties, each of which requires a separate storage slot. There is an array of 8 "payments" structs, so the total number of storage slots used by the "topPayments" array is 8 x 8 = 64.

In addition, there is a mapping named "balances" that associates addresses with uint256 values, and a public uint256 variable named "number". Each entry in the mapping also requires a separate storage slot.

The boolean variables "flag1", "flag2", and "flag3", and the uint8 variable "index" can be packed into a single storage slot, since they all fit into 1 byte.

The address variables "admin" and "admin2" each require 20 bytes, which is a full storage slot.

Therefore, the total number of storage slots used by the "Store" contract is:

- 64 storage slots for the "topPayments" array
- 2 storage slots for the "admin" and "admin2" addresses
- 1 storage slot for the "number" variable
- N storage slots for the "balances" mapping, where N is the number of entries in the mapping.
