1. The `addNewPlayer` function doesn't check if the `_playerAddress` is a valid Ethereum address, which can lead to players losing their funds if they send it to an invalid address.

2. The `addNewPlayer` function allows anyone to add a player by sending exactly 500000 wei, which means that an attacker can create a script to flood the contract with fake players and potentially trigger the `winnersPaid` event before the maximum number of players is reached, causing the prize to be distributed prematurely.

3. The `pickWinner` function only allows the winner to be picked at specific times (when block.timestamp % 15 == 0), which means that an attacker can keep calling this function until they find a suitable time to win the prize. This can be done by monitoring the blockchain and predicting when the next suitable time will be.

4. The payout function checks if the contract balance is exactly 500000 * 100 wei, which means that an attacker can send a small amount of ether to the contract to manipulate the balance and trigger the `distributePrize` function prematurely.

5. The `distributePrize` function has a loop that runs from 0 to `prize_winners.length`, which means that an attacker can create a large number of fake winners to exhaust the gas limit and prevent the function from executing. This can be done by creating a large number of fake addresses and adding them to the `prize_winners` array.
