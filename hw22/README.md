I've followed quickNode tutotial and have written `index.js`

By starting `node index` we can see the mempool logs

3. To filter only PancakeSwap transactions we've checked address in `subscription.on`

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) and front-running are both challenges that can affect the integrity and fairness of decentralized applications (Dapps). Here are some approaches you could consider to mitigate MEV and front-running in your own Dapp:

Implement Fair Ordering: One of the main ways front-running occurs is when a transaction is executed out of order. To mitigate this, you could implement fair ordering of transactions by using a commit-reveal scheme. This means that users first commit their transactions and then reveal them at a later time. This approach makes it difficult for miners to front-run transactions because they don't know what transactions will be executed in what order.

Use Secret Contracts: Secret contracts are a type of smart contract that can hide the input data and the output data from anyone who is not authorized to see them. This can help to prevent front-running because the data that is being transmitted cannot be seen by anyone other than those who are authorized to see it.

Implement Flashbots: Flashbots is a platform that allows Dapp developers to send bundles of transactions directly to miners. This can help to mitigate MEV by allowing Dapp developers to create private transactions that are not visible to the public mempool. This approach can also help to prevent front-running because the transactions are bundled together and sent to miners all at once, making it difficult for individual miners to front-run any single transaction.
