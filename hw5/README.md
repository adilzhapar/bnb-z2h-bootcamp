1. after choosing injected provider in Remix IDE, we've deployed the contract to BSC testnet
2. Find the contract address in BSC testnet:
3. verify & publish it:
https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xaf82f201b8d6b3921c30c43b071b49160dce84f9
4. We can add this token in metamask now
5. and also, we can test read/write contract in testnet.bscscan.com
